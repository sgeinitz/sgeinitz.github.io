## Bio/Background {#bio}
My name is Steve Geinitz and I’m an associate professor of [Computer Science at
Metropolitan State University of
Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu/computer-sciences/). I hold a PhD in Applied
Statistics from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), an MSc
in Computer Science, and BSc’s in Computer Science and Mathematics. My
professional experience ranges from small start-ups to large global tech
companies, but always with an aim of wielding data science and machine learning
to improve an organization's/company’s products and services. This underlying
goal continues in education as well, where I am developing and experimenting
with novel pedagogical techniques to improve student outcomes.

## Projects/Research {#projects}
For interested students, there are a few projects available to work on. There
may be funding available to work on these depending on the semester, but there
is always the opportunity to extend these into a research project. Within MSU,
a project can culminate in publication in the [Rowdy
Scholar](https://www.msudenver.edu/rowdy-scholar/), a presentation at the
[Undergraduate Research
Conference](https://www.msudenver.edu/undergraduate-research-creative-scholarship-program/undergraduate-research-conference/),
or a publication in an academic journal.

#### Canvigator: A digital teaching assistant for Canvas
[Canvigator](https://github.com/sgeinitz/canvigator) is an evolving piece of
software built on top of the Canvas LMS that provides additional utilities and
enhances tried-and-true instructional methods. Longer-term development goals
include the integration of machine learning models that can provide
personalized follow-up assessments, predict student performance trajectories,
and provide the instructor with detailed insights about how students are
progressing through the course content.

* Benefits and usage examples: By automating collaborative quizzes, intelligently assigning student pairs, generating tailored follow-up questions, and analyzing quiz outcomes to highlight where students may need support, Canvigator helps reduce administrative overhead and provides richer visibility into class learning patterns.

* Skills a student researcher needs to contribute: Useful preparation includes Python programming and basic software-engineering practices. Experience with machine learning and/or data analysis is helpful but not required. More importantly, a curiosity about learning analytics and a willingness to work iteratively on applied software systems is what is needed.


#### Technology-Enhanced Pedagogical Methods
This line of research investigates and develops scalable, technology-supported
extensions of proven teaching strategies such as collaborative learning, peer
instruction, and continuous assessment. The goal is to design digital tools and
algorithms that help instructors implement these practices more effectively and
personalize them to the needs of different learners. Research threads may
include modeling student knowledge over time (e.g. knowledge tracing),
generating formative assessments, and evaluating how technology influences
participation, understanding, and academic outcomes.

* Benefits and usage examples: These methods can support dynamic student pairings, adaptive quizzes, data-informed study recommendations, and real-time feedback loops between students and instructors. Benefits include improved engagement, more accurate identification of at-risk learners, and enhanced opportunities for students to learn through structured collaboration.

* Skills a student researcher needs to contribute: A background in statistics or machine learning is valuable, as is familiarity with Python or another language for data analysis. Students interested in educational techniques, human-centered computing, and/or experimentation in educational settings will find natural entry points. A comfort with designing small studies or analyzing data is also useful. Above all, most important is a desire to improve student outcomes and a willingness to commit to carrying out a study from start to finish.
