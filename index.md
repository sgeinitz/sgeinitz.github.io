## Bio/Background
My name is Steve Geinitz and I’m an assistant professor of [Computer Science at Metropolitan State University of Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu/computer-sciences/). I hold a PhD in Applied Statistics from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) (under the supervision of [Reinhard Furrer](https://user.math.uzh.ch/furrer/)), an MSc in Computer Science, and BSc’s in Computer Science and Mathematics. My professional experience ranges from small start-ups to large global tech companies, but always with an aim of wielding both data and science to improve the company’s products/services.

## Projects/Research
For interested MSU students there are a few projects available to work on. There may be funding available to work on these, depending on the semester, but there is always the opportunity to extend these into a research project that can be published in [The Rowdy Scholar](https://www.msudenver.edu/rowdy-scholar/) or presented at the [Undergraduate Research Conference](https://www.msudenver.edu/undergraduate-research-creative-scholarship-program/undergraduate-research-conference/). Most of these projects revolve around Computer Science education or improving education with technology (yes, getting students into the computer science pipeline is another issue, but one which I haven’t delved into yet).


#### 1. Improving student success rates in CS courses
This project is broad in scope and involves analyzing data and developing/implementing tools to help students to learn more effectively in core CS courses using Continuous Assessments (e.g. weekly quizzes) and Peer Instruction (e.g. in-class tasks/assignments completed by pairs or small groups of students working together). Given the broad scope, it’s possible to focus entirely on just one of the following.

- **Creating content for continuous assessments (e.g. quizzes)** - create a library of quiz content on specific core CS topics at varying levels of difficulty to help students learn core CS concepts
- **Carry out (reproducible) data analyses** - this is a Data Science type of task that involves writing Python code/notebooks to collect and analyze quiz/exam data (from Canvas); the two main parts of this task are 1) collecting the data, mostly via the Canvas API, and b) running statistical analyses on the data; an early version of this can be found at [github.com/sgeinitz/picata](https://github.com/sgeinitz/picata)
- **Implementing communication tools** - this final task is to help automate the process of selecting pairs/small groups of students and given them a brief quiz/assignment, with a longer-term goal of offering students personalized study tips/guidance in a course; this will likely involve the creation of a chatbot or similar messaging tool


#### 2. Natural Language Processing
This project is about applying deep learning models to textual and sequential data with one a specific use-case of analyzing open-ended responses to surveys/quizzes. However, the possible applications of NLP are vast so if you are interested in applying NLP to another domain that is a possibility as well. For example, one other project in this area is to utilize an existing large language model (e.g. BERT) and fine-tune it to be used as a ‘Course Assistant’ in a CS course. This may include aspects of the third task above (e.g. implementing an MS Teams chatbot).


#### 3. General Data Science/Machine Learning
Although not an explicit project, if you are interested in competing in Kaggle competitions, or have some other Data Science or Machine Learning task that you would like to tackle but need some additional help, then feel free to reach out for consulting and possible mentorship.
