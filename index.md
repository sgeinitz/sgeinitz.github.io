## Bio/Background
My name is Steve Geinitz and I’m an associate professor of [Computer Science at
Metropolitan State University of
Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu/computer-sciences/). I hold a PhD in Applied
Statistics from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), an MSc
in Computer Science, and BSc’s in Computer Science and Mathematics. My
professional experience ranges from small start-ups to large global tech
companies, but always with an aim of wielding data science and machine learning
to improve an organization's/company’s products and services. This underlying
goal continues in education as well, where I am developing and experimenting
with novel pedagogical techniques to improve student outcomes.

## Projects/Research
For interested students, there are a few projects available to work on. There
may be funding available to work on these, depending on the semester, but there
is always the opportunity to extend these into a research project. Within MSU,
a project can culminate in publication in the [Rowdy
Scholar](https://www.msudenver.edu/rowdy-scholar/), a presentation at the
[Undergraduate Research
Conference](https://www.msudenver.edu/undergraduate-research-creative-scholarship-program/undergraduate-research-conference/),
or a publication in an academic journal.


#### 1. Digital Teaching Assistant for Canvas
Currently a set of Python scripts are used to facilitate the collaborative
quizzes given in the courses I teach. This includes assigning students
a partner to work on the quiz with and awarding collaboration bonuses.  The
Python code for doing this is located in this
[repository](https://github.com/sgeinitz/picata), but it is quite rudimentary
right now.  Longer term the goal is to develop this code into a more
sophisticated stand-alone tool to assist instructors in utilizing and
experimenting with these types of collaborative quizzes. This software can be
further developed in the future to send students personalized follow-up quiz
questions through Canvas, and to have their responses graded and scored. 

#### 2. Knowledge Tracing
At the core of this project is the development of advanced algorithms for
tracking and analyzing student learning trajectories based solely on their quiz
results. The goal is to implement machine learning techniques to accurately
predict students' future performance and identify areas where they might
struggle. This knowledge tracing system will provide valuable insights into the
learning process, enabling more effective and personalized educational support.
Knowledge Tracing is a developed concept in educational research related to
data mining and learning systems (see this [survey
paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3569576) for more info).  However,
here is a simple example to help explain:

Imagine a student has taken several quizzes in their Discrete Math class.  The
quizzes each had several questions, and each question covered a specific topic
or concept. Suppose there is a new quiz that the student will take the next
time they are in class. Given how they scored on each of the questions on the
previous quizzes, we want to predict how the student will score for each
individual question on the new quiz. While the scope of this example is rather
small, you can imagine how being able to make accurate predictions would be
very helpful, since it would allow us to personalize a student's learning and 
optimize their learning journey overall. 

#### 3. LLM-generated Follow-up Assessments
This project focuses on leveraging LLMs to create personalized quiz questions
and study tools for students. Unlike the two projects above, this one is
focused more on the use of language models to analyze past quiz questions (to
understand what concept they cover), and then to generate a new quiz question
or study task over a given concept and that is similar to the past questions
the student saw. 
For example, suppose it has already been determine that a student in Discrete Mathematics needs
extra help with Counting Techniques (e.g. combinations, permutations). The goal would then be
to generate a new problem or quiz question on Counting Techniques, and this new
question/problem should be of similar difficulty (or perhaps easier or harder). 

All of the above projects would eventually lead to creating tools designed to
adapt to individual student needs, to enhance their learning experience, and
improve their understanding of complex computer science concepts.


#### 4. General Data Science/Machine Learning
Although not an explicit project, if you are interested in competing in Kaggle
competitions, or have some other Data Science or Machine Learning task that you
would like to tackle but would like some support or mentorship, then feel free
to reach out.
