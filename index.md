## Bio/Background
My name is Steve Geinitz and I’m an assistant professor of [Computer Science at Metropolitan State University of Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu/computer-sciences/). I hold a PhD in Applied Statistics from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), an MSc in Computer Science, and BSc’s in Computer Science and Mathematics. My professional experience ranges from small start-ups to large global tech companies, but always with an aim of wielding both data and science to improve the company’s products/services.

## Projects/Research
For interested students, there are a few projects available to work on. There may be funding available to work on these, depending on the semester, but there is always the opportunity to extend these into a research project. Within MSU, a project can culminate in [Rowdy Scholar](https://www.msudenver.edu/rowdy-scholar/) publication, or presentation at the [Undergraduate Research Conference](https://www.msudenver.edu/undergraduate-research-creative-scholarship-program/undergraduate-research-conference/). All of these projects revolve around Computer Science education or improving education with technology (yes, getting students into the computer science pipeline is another issue, but one which I haven’t delved into yet).


#### 1. Development of a Digital TA
Currently a set of Python scripts are used to facilitate the past project, PICA: A data-driven synthesis of Peer Instruction and Continuous Assessment. In the future, this rudimentary Python program named [picata](https://github.com/sgeinitz/picata) will be exanded and generalized to allow for other tasks such as creating LLM-generated follow-up quizzes and individual quiz questions (2.) for students based on concepts that they are struggling with in the course (3.). 

#### 2. LLM-generated Instruments


#### 3. Knowledge Tracing


#### 4. General Data Science/Machine Learning
Although not an explicit project, if you are interested in competing in Kaggle competitions, or have some other Data Science or Machine Learning task that you would like to tackle but with support, feel free to reach out for consulting and possible mentorship.
